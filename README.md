# React Course Projects

This repository contains all the projects and exercises I built while following a React course.  
Each folder represents a course section and includes a standalone React project.

---

## 📂 Structure

The projects are organized by course sections:

- **01 Getting Started**
- **02 JS Refresher**
- **03 React Essentials**
- **04 Essentials Deep Dive**
- **05 Essentials Practice**
- **06 Debugging**
- **07 Styling**
- **08 Refs Portals**
- _(and more as the course progresses)_

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run any project:

1. **Navigate to a project folder**  
   Example:

   ```bash
   cd "03 React Essentials"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📌 Notes

- Each project is independent with its own `package.json`.
- You don’t need to install dependencies for the whole repo — only for the project you want to run.
- The numbering (`01`, `02`, `03`, …) matches the sections of the course.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo serves as:

- A **learning journal** for tracking my progress through the React course.
- A **reference** for revisiting concepts and examples.
- A **showcase** of my journey in mastering React.
